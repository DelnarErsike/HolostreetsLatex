- test TitleImage functionality
- modify chatter to be nicer?
- just get rid of smalltext, don't need it for that one bit
- fix the bottom-of-page title stuff on some pages, like the TOC
- author on title page
- attribution to the layout

- implement weapon, sritem, featurearmour, armour, cyberware, etc.
    - idea of these is that we have a table we can autogenerate with all the stuff
      in a given category, but I don't know how to make that... yet
